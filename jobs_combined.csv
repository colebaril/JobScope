Renseignements sur l’équité en matière d’emploi


Les communications concernant ce processus seront transmises par courriel. Il incombe aux candidats de s'assurer que leurs coordonnées sont exactes et mises à jour, au besoin.  

  

Les candidats qui participent à ce processus de sélection devraient inclure une adresse de courrier électronique qui accepte les courriels d'utilisateurs inconnus (certains systèmes de courrier électronique bloquent ces types de courriel.) Les candidats sont fortement encouragés à vérifier régulièrement leur boîte de courrier électronique.  

  

Les candidats ont le droit de participer au processus de nomination dans la langue officielle de leur choix. Nous demandons aux candidats de mentionner leur langue préférée dans leur demande d'emploi.  

  

Les décisions de nomination peuvent être fondées sur un ou plusieurs des critères suivants :  

* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les forces et les faiblesses de l'équipe de travail;
* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les fonctions particulières du poste à doter;
* importance, ampleur et type d'expérience liée au travail;

Toutes les communications liées à ce processus, y compris les courriels, pourraient être utilisées pour évaluer les qualifications.  

  

Les candidats de l’extérieur de la fonction publique fédérale pourraient devoir payer leurs propres dépenses de déplacement.  

  

Aucun accusé de réception des demandes ne sera envoyé; nous ne communiquerons qu'avec les candidats retenus lors du processus de présélection.  

  

Selon les exigences du poste ou des postes à doter dans le cadre du présent concours en prévision de vacances à l’heure actuelle ou à l’avenir, il pourrait être tenu compte, au moment de la présélection, de l’ensemble des qualités considérées comme un atout, des exigences opérationnelles et des besoins organisationnels.  

  

Afin de pouvoir gérer le nombre de candidats dans le présent processus de sélection, la direction peut utiliser une approche descendante quant aux notes, à diverses étapes du processus, afin de déterminer le nombre de candidats qualifiés qui passeront à l’étape suivante.  

  

Les candidats convoqués à une entrevue devront apporter leur(s) attestation(s) d'études/grade(s), soit l'original du ou des diplômes(s) ou relevé(s) de notes officiel(s), ainsi qu'une copie de ce(s) document(s).  

  

Comme le jury de présélection ne peut présumer que les candidats possèdent l’expérience requise, il est important que ceux\\-ci démontrent clairement dans quelle mesure ils satisfont aux exigences reliées aux critères d’expérience énumérés ci\\-dessus, en donnant des exemples pour chacun des éléments. Nous ne communiquerons pas avec les candidats pour compléter ou ajouter des renseignements et leur demande pourra être rejetée.  

  

Les décisions relatives à la nomination peuvent être fondées sur les besoins organisationnels. Les candidats sont donc encouragés à indiquer leur appartenance à l’un des groupes visés par l’équité en matière d’emploi (minorités visibles, Autochtones, personnes handicapées et femmes), si jamais ce besoin organisationnel est invoqué au cours du processus de nomination.

Renseignements sur l’équité en matière d’emploi


Les communications concernant ce processus seront transmises par courriel. Il incombe aux candidats de s'assurer que leurs coordonnées sont exactes et mises à jour, au besoin.

Les candidats ont le droit de participer au processus de nomination dans la langue officielle de leur choix. Nous demandons aux candidats de mentionner leur langue préférée dans leur demande d'emploi.  

  

Les décisions de nomination peuvent être fondées sur un ou plusieurs des critères suivants :  

* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les forces et les faiblesses de l'équipe de travail;
* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les fonctions particulières du poste à doter;
* importance, ampleur et type d'expérience liée au travail;

Selon les exigences du poste ou des postes à doter dans le cadre du présent concours en prévision de vacances à l’heure actuelle ou à l’avenir, il pourrait être tenu compte, au moment de la présélection, de l’ensemble des qualités considérées comme un atout, des exigences opérationnelles et des besoins organisationnels.  

  

Afin de pouvoir gérer le nombre de candidats dans le présent processus de sélection, la direction peut utiliser une approche descendante quant aux notes, à diverses étapes du processus, afin de déterminer le nombre de candidats qualifiés qui passeront à l’étape suivante.  

  

Les candidats convoqués à une entrevue devront apporter leur(s) attestation(s) d'études/grade(s), soit l'original du ou des diplômes(s) ou relevé(s) de notes officiel(s), ainsi qu'une copie de ce(s) document(s).

Nous ne communiquerons pas avec les candidats pour compléter ou ajouter des renseignements et leur demande pourra être rejetée.  

  

Les décisions relatives à la nomination peuvent être fondées sur les besoins organisationnels. Les candidats sont donc encouragés à indiquer leur appartenance à l’un des groupes visés par l’équité en matière d’emploi (minorités visibles, Autochtones, personnes handicapées et femmes), si jamais ce besoin organisationnel est invoqué au cours du processus de nomination.

Forestry and Peatlands Branch is seeking individuals to perform a technical field position that requires conducting forest surveys and data collection. There are two streams of programming within the Forestry Field Services program: Forest Health and Urban Forestry, and Forest Inventory and Regeneration. The Forest Health and Urban Forestry stream includes conducting surveys and data collection on forest health surveys, including invasive species surveys and the provincial Dutch elm disease program. This stream focuses on public engagement and surveys within urban settings, plot establishment and monitoring of forest health programs within forest settings, and urban forestry programming, such as the 2 Billion Tree initiative. This work is typically performed within a team environment, however, may include surveying independently. The Forest Inventory and Regeneration stream includes conducting field surveys and data collection on forest renewal programs. This stream focuses on assessing forest regeneration, collecting inventory data via measuring heights and diameters, and plant species identification. The forest inventory and regeneration stream involves working and staying in remote and isolated locations and may include surveying independently.

This analysis is multifaceted. The revenue analyst tracks revenue over time and determines the direction of the trend. He determines how a company's revenue compares to competitors in the industry. The analyst breaks down revenue by individual product and service and determines which goods are making the company money and which are not. He matches revenues to expenses for each business segment to determine the relative profitability of each segment. A revenue analyst must possess an almost preternatural attention to detail and be highly accurate with his work.

Revenue analysts are responsible for taking large sets of numerical data and extracting from them valuable information about the company's revenue that management can use to make business decisions. The amount of specialization for a revenue analyst varies from position to position, with large companies often employing more specialized analysts and smaller companies hiring fewer analysts but training them on the entire breadth of the field.

Some revenue analysts take a micro approach to analyzing data. In other words, they draw conclusions from examining strictly company data. Their reports are mínimally influenced by external forces or broader economic data. For this type of revenue analyst, common job duties include matching revenues to expenses for various business segments; tracking the revenues of a company product or service, or for the company as a whole, over time and charting the trend; and brainstorming potential ways to increase revenue without affecting a concomitant increase in expenses.

We are a team of innovative information technology experts committed to removing your IT burden and communicating with you in a language you can understand. Our motto is: Technology is complicated. It is hard for you to keep up, and that is frustrating. HUB Technology Solutions makes technology simple and stress\-free.

This analysis is multifaceted. The revenue analyst tracks revenue over time and determines the direction of the trend. He determines how a company's revenue compares to competitors in the industry. The analyst breaks down revenue by individual product and service and determines which goods are making the company money and which are not. He matches revenues to expenses for each business segment to determine the relative profitability of each segment. A revenue analyst must possess an almost preternatural attention to detail and be highly accurate with his work.

Revenue analysts are responsible for taking large sets of numerical data and extracting from them valuable information about the company's revenue that management can use to make business decisions. The amount of specialization for a revenue analyst varies from position to position, with large companies often employing more specialized analysts and smaller companies hiring fewer analysts but training them on the entire breadth of the field.

Some revenue analysts take a micro approach to analyzing data. In other words, they draw conclusions from examining strictly company data. Their reports are mínimally influenced by external forces or broader economic data. For this type of revenue analyst, common job duties include matching revenues to expenses for various business segments; tracking the revenues of a company product or service, or for the company as a whole, over time and charting the trend; and brainstorming potential ways to increase revenue without affecting a concomitant increase in expenses.

We are a team of innovative information technology experts committed to removing your IT burden and communicating with you in a language you can understand. Our motto is: Technology is complicated. It is hard for you to keep up, and that is frustrating. HUB Technology Solutions makes technology simple and stress\-free.
