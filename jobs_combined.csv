Renseignements sur l’équité en matière d’emploi


Les communications concernant ce processus seront transmises par courriel. Il incombe aux candidats de s'assurer que leurs coordonnées sont exactes et mises à jour, au besoin.  

  

Les candidats qui participent à ce processus de sélection devraient inclure une adresse de courrier électronique qui accepte les courriels d'utilisateurs inconnus (certains systèmes de courrier électronique bloquent ces types de courriel.) Les candidats sont fortement encouragés à vérifier régulièrement leur boîte de courrier électronique.  

  

Les candidats ont le droit de participer au processus de nomination dans la langue officielle de leur choix. Nous demandons aux candidats de mentionner leur langue préférée dans leur demande d'emploi.  

  

Les décisions de nomination peuvent être fondées sur un ou plusieurs des critères suivants :  

* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les forces et les faiblesses de l'équipe de travail;
* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les fonctions particulières du poste à doter;
* importance, ampleur et type d'expérience liée au travail;

Toutes les communications liées à ce processus, y compris les courriels, pourraient être utilisées pour évaluer les qualifications.  

  

Les candidats de l’extérieur de la fonction publique fédérale pourraient devoir payer leurs propres dépenses de déplacement.  

  

Aucun accusé de réception des demandes ne sera envoyé; nous ne communiquerons qu'avec les candidats retenus lors du processus de présélection.  

  

Selon les exigences du poste ou des postes à doter dans le cadre du présent concours en prévision de vacances à l’heure actuelle ou à l’avenir, il pourrait être tenu compte, au moment de la présélection, de l’ensemble des qualités considérées comme un atout, des exigences opérationnelles et des besoins organisationnels.  

  

Afin de pouvoir gérer le nombre de candidats dans le présent processus de sélection, la direction peut utiliser une approche descendante quant aux notes, à diverses étapes du processus, afin de déterminer le nombre de candidats qualifiés qui passeront à l’étape suivante.  

  

Les candidats convoqués à une entrevue devront apporter leur(s) attestation(s) d'études/grade(s), soit l'original du ou des diplômes(s) ou relevé(s) de notes officiel(s), ainsi qu'une copie de ce(s) document(s).  

  

Comme le jury de présélection ne peut présumer que les candidats possèdent l’expérience requise, il est important que ceux\\-ci démontrent clairement dans quelle mesure ils satisfont aux exigences reliées aux critères d’expérience énumérés ci\\-dessus, en donnant des exemples pour chacun des éléments. Nous ne communiquerons pas avec les candidats pour compléter ou ajouter des renseignements et leur demande pourra être rejetée.  

  

Les décisions relatives à la nomination peuvent être fondées sur les besoins organisationnels. Les candidats sont donc encouragés à indiquer leur appartenance à l’un des groupes visés par l’équité en matière d’emploi (minorités visibles, Autochtones, personnes handicapées et femmes), si jamais ce besoin organisationnel est invoqué au cours du processus de nomination.

Renseignements sur l’équité en matière d’emploi


Les communications concernant ce processus seront transmises par courriel. Il incombe aux candidats de s'assurer que leurs coordonnées sont exactes et mises à jour, au besoin.  

  

Les candidats qui participent à ce processus de sélection devraient inclure une adresse de courrier électronique qui accepte les courriels d'utilisateurs inconnus (certains systèmes de courrier électronique bloquent ces types de courriel.) Les candidats sont fortement encouragés à vérifier régulièrement leur boîte de courrier électronique.  

  

Les candidats ont le droit de participer au processus de nomination dans la langue officielle de leur choix. Nous demandons aux candidats de mentionner leur langue préférée dans leur demande d'emploi.  

  

Les décisions de nomination peuvent être fondées sur un ou plusieurs des critères suivants :  

* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les forces et les faiblesses de l'équipe de travail;
* concordance entre l'expérience ou les qualifications de la personne et les fonctions particulières du poste à doter;
* importance, ampleur et type d'expérience liée au travail;

Aucun accusé de réception des demandes ne sera envoyé; nous ne communiquerons qu'avec les candidats retenus lors du processus de présélection.  

  

Selon les exigences du poste ou des postes à doter dans le cadre du présent concours en prévision de vacances à l’heure actuelle ou à l’avenir, il pourrait être tenu compte, au moment de la présélection, de l’ensemble des qualités considérées comme un atout, des exigences opérationnelles et des besoins organisationnels.  

  

Afin de pouvoir gérer le nombre de candidats dans le présent processus de sélection, la direction peut utiliser une approche descendante quant aux notes, à diverses étapes du processus, afin de déterminer le nombre de candidats qualifiés qui passeront à l’étape suivante.  

  

Les candidats convoqués à une entrevue devront apporter leur(s) attestation(s) d'études/grade(s), soit l'original du ou des diplômes(s) ou relevé(s) de notes officiel(s), ainsi qu'une copie de ce(s) document(s).  

  

Comme le jury de présélection ne peut présumer que les candidats possèdent l’expérience requise, il est important que ceux\\-ci démontrent clairement dans quelle mesure ils satisfont aux exigences reliées aux critères d’expérience énumérés ci\\-dessus, en donnant des exemples pour chacun des éléments. Nous ne communiquerons pas avec les candidats pour compléter ou ajouter des renseignements et leur demande pourra être rejetée.  

  

Les décisions relatives à la nomination peuvent être fondées sur les besoins organisationnels. Les candidats sont donc encouragés à indiquer leur appartenance à l’un des groupes visés par l’équité en matière d’emploi (minorités visibles, Autochtones, personnes handicapées et femmes), si jamais ce besoin organisationnel est invoqué au cours du processus de nomination.
