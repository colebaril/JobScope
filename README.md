I built a GitHub Actions workflow and [Shiny app](https://colewb.shinyapps.io/JobScope/) that automates daily job scraping at midnight GMT, gathering postings from Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and Google Jobs based on predefined keywords. The script compiles these listings into a centralized table, appending new data while preserving historical results. Designed to save time, this solution streamlines the job search process by eliminating the need to manually check multiple job boards, providing an efficient and organized way to track relevant opportunities.
